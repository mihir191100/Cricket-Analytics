# Cricket Analytics using Python and PowerBI
Over the last decade adoption of analytics has led to significant improvement in results in all sports. In this project we want to mimic how computer analysts associated with IPL teams help them find the best fit batsman and bowler for their team. Data analysis helps IPL teams to answer the following questions: “Should they spend on a particular player or not?” or “How valuable is the player going to be for the team?” How should they judge in detail, “Which player should they buy and which one they shouldn't?”, “How much money should be spent on which player?” or “What are the values of the different players?”.

You will not believe that, but IPL teams have started hiring proper companies who are experts in
such Data Analysis.

### Problem Statement
The owners and the management of Mumbai Indians want to identify the best possible players suitable for them for the next auction. They have hired you as an Analyst to help them identify the best IPL team for the 2022 auction. You need to analyze the IPL data from 2008 to 2020, and perform the following tasks:
- Rank batsmen by year and overall based on ability
- Rank bowlers by year and overall based on ability
- Rank the most valuable player in IPL over all the years
- Visualize this in an intuitive Power BI Dashboards
- Find Similar Batsmen and Bowler
